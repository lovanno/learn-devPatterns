/* Definitions:
forEach - The forEach() method executes a provided function once for each array element.
map - The map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
filter - The filter() method creates a shallow copy of a portion of a given array, filtered down to just the elements from the
given array that pass the test implemented by the provided function*/

//Exercise: Re-implement forEach, map and filter using reduce, and to do it in a type safe manner using Typescript.
