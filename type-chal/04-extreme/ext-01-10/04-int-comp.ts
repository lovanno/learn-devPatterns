/*                                    Integers Comparator
Link: https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges/blob/main/questions/00274-extreme-integers-comparator/README.md
Implement a type-level integers comparator. We've provided an enum for indicating the comparison result, like this:
    Note: a and b can be positive integers or negative integers or zero, even one is positive while another one is negative.

If a is greater than b, type should be Comparison.Greater.
If a and b are equal, type should be Comparison.Equal.
If a is lower than b, type should be Comparison.Lower.*/
