Link: https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges/blob/main/questions/08987-medium-subsequence/README.md
Given an array of unique elements, return all possible subsequences.
A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing 
the order of the remaining elements.*/

/*Example:
type mResult3 = Concat<[1], [2]> // expected to be [1, 2]*//*                                    Concat

Implement the JavaScript Array.concat function in the type system. 
A type takes the two arguments. The output should be a new array that includes inputs in ltr order*/

/*Example:
type A = Subsequence<[1, 2]> // [] | [1] | [2] | [1, 2]*/
