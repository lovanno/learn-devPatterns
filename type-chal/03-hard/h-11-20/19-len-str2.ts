/*                                    Length of String 2
Link: https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges/blob/main/questions/00651-hard-length-of-string-2/README.md
Implement a type LengthOfString<S> that calculates the length of the template string (as in 298 - Length of String):
The type must support strings several hundred characters long (the usual recursive calculation of the string length is 
limited by the depth of recursive function calls in TS, that is, it supports strings up to about 45 characters long).*/

/*Example:
type T0 = LengthOfString<"foo"> // 3*/
