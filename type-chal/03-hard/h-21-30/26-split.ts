/*                                    Split
Link: https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges/blob/main/questions/02822-hard-split/README.md
The well known split() method splits a string into an array of substrings by looking for a separator, and returns the 
new array. The goal of this challenge is to split a string, by using a separator, but in the type system!*/

/*Example:
type result = Split<'Hi! How are you?', ' '>  // should be ['Hi!', 'How', 'are', 'you?']*/
